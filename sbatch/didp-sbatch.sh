## Lines beginning with "#SBATCH" specify an sbatch configurations.
## We use "##" for commentary. 

## Sbatch configuration are used by Slurm to allocate resources. It throws an
## error if it cannot satisfy them.


## Each individual command given to the gnu `parallel` is a "task".

## For sbatch parameter list, https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html

## As of November-2024, each niagara node has 40 CPUs each with 2 threads, and
## when a node is reserved the total number of CPUs shows as 80 (threads).

## Slurm allocates CPU-threads to a task, not CPUs.

## Number of nodes requested
#SBATCH --nodes=1

## TIDEL account name.
#SBATCH --account=def-beck

## The "--time" argument specifies the requested time period of node allocation.
## It is specified in the HH:MM:SS format.
## As of November-2024, 
##  - the max value is 24:00:00
##  - the min value is 00:15:00
## It is advisable to request 30 minutes more than the expected run time.
#SBATCH --time=07:30:00

## "--ntasks-per-node" parameter tells Slurm the number of parallel task runs.
## Typical value: minimum of 40 and (175 GB / memory-limit-per-task)
## For comparative evaluation, this value should be same across all scripts to
##   ensure that the same number of processes are run in parallel on all nodes.
## This value is used at two places:
## 1. To set the number of CPUs in the resource allocation request. 
## 2. Assigned to SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE environment variable.
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=20

## "--cpus-per-task" tells the expected count of CPU "threads" per task
##
## Each CPU core on Niagara node allows two threads to share it. However, that
##  results in slower execution as the two threads contend for shared resources
##  like the CPU cache, execution units and registers.
## To make sure a single-threaded process gets a full CPU core allocated to it,
##  we set cpus-per-task=2, so the request requires slurm to allocate twice the
##  number of threads (or same number CPU cores as tasks per node).
##
## Typical value: 2, which is equal to the threads per CPU core on Niagara.
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2

## "--ntasks-per-node" and "--cpus-per-task" are used by slurm to formulate the 
##  allocation request, requested CPU Threads: ntasks-per-node * cpus-per-task.

## Comments on the below command:
## 1. The symbol {1} and {2} refers to items in the first and second lists: 
##      {1..3} and 10 20 30.
## 2. Any number of lists can be given as input to gnu-parallel.
## 3. Gnu-parallel will run the test_didp.py script in parallel for all 
##      combinations of '{1}' and '{2}'. 
## 4. -j specifies the number of tasks run in parallel on a node.
## 5. `tee` directs a copy of stdout to the log file.
